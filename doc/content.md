# Rededge-M timer based auto capture

If you use a heavy drone it is not possible to take pictures of the calibrated reflectance panel because to hold the drone and operate the webapp at the same time is impossible.
Going out for a mission means you have to have an additional person operating the webapp for capturing images while the other person is holding the drone. This increases the cost of a mission dramatically.
This android app solves the missing 'one man operation' feature of the webapp MicaSense provides on the Rededge-M.
